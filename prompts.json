    "prompt": "You are an expert annotation quality checker for elementary-school math tutoring dialogues.\n\nYour task: Review ONLY existing annotations and determine if they correctly identify PROVIDING_EXPLANATION according to the ORIGINAL ANNOTATION CRITERIA below.\n\n## ORIGINAL ANNOTATION CRITERIA (used to create the annotations you're checking)\n\nThe original annotator was given this exact prompt:\n\n\"You are an expert elementaryâ€“school math tutor.\nYour task: is to identify whether each teacher utterance contains a PROVIDING_EXPLANATION move.\n\n## Workflow\n1. **Read** the dialogue.\n2. **Identify** which teacher utterances contain PROVIDING_EXPLANATION moves.\n3. **Omit** any turns that are off-topic, administrative, or not directly about solving the math problem.\n4. **Ignore** all other types of teacher moves - only annotate PROVIDING_EXPLANATION.\n\n## Target Move Definition\nPROVIDING_EXPLANATION: Teacher delivers a clear explanation or factual information relevant to the problem. This includes:\n- Explaining mathematical concepts or procedures\n- Clarifying why something works the way it does\n- Providing factual information about the problem\n- Explaining steps in a solution process\n\n## Important Instructions\n- ONLY identify utterances that contain PROVIDING_EXPLANATION\n- Do NOT annotate other types of moves (hints, praise, questions, etc.)\n- If an utterance does not contain a clear explanation, do not annotate it\n- Return 'PROVIDING_EXPLANATION' exactly as shown (no variations)\n\n## Examples of PROVIDING_EXPLANATION\n1. 'But you also have the 16 side. If this was a square or rectangle, you would just think that both sides are equal, but it isn't, at least not yet!'\n2. 'The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length times width.'\n3. 'When we subtract 146 from 180, we're finding the difference between these two numbers, which gives us 34.'\n\n## Examples of what is NOT PROVIDING_EXPLANATION\n- Questions: 'Have you heard of the Pythagorean theorem?' (This is prompting, not explaining)\n- Hints: 'So half of 71 bucks should be BIG!' (This is hinting, not explaining)\n- Praise: 'Good job! That's right!' (This is praise, not explaining)\n- Simple corrections without explanation: 'It should be 34' (This lacks explanation)\"\n\n## YOUR QUALITY CHECK TASK\n\nUsing the EXACT criteria above, assess each existing annotation:\n- Was the utterance correctly identified as PROVIDING_EXPLANATION?\n- Does the utterance truly contain a clear explanation or factual information?\n- Does it match the examples of what SHOULD be annotated?\n- Does it avoid the examples of what should NOT be annotated?\n\n## Quality Assessment Criteria:\n- ACCURATE: The annotation correctly follows the original criteria - the utterance contains a clear explanation of mathematical concepts/procedures\n- INACCURATE: The annotation violates the original criteria - it's a question, hint, praise, simple correction, or doesn't contain clear explanation\n\n## Output Format:\nFor each existing annotation, provide your assessment:\n- utterance_id: The ID of the annotated utterance\n- qualityStatus: \"ACCURATE\" or \"INACCURATE\"\n- reasoning: Your detailed explanation (required ONLY when INACCURATE)\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- Judge each annotation against the ORIGINAL CRITERIA above\n- ONLY assess utterances that already have annotations\n- Do NOT identify missed annotations\n- Output a JSON array: [{\"utterance_id\": 7, \"qualityStatus\": \"ACCURATE\"}, {\"utterance_id\": 12, \"qualityStatus\": \"INACCURATE\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a question, not an explanation per the original criteria\"}]",
