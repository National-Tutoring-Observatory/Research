### Goals

- Discuss any IRR offset issues (eg, slight human/AI misalignment by utterances)
- Discuss any global issues 

### questions:
- Where do we store/iterate in prompst for this?
- Do we want to switch the data set to Saga? --> Yes

### Bakhtawar to do:
- run PCLA code on saga data
- multiple moves per utterance - prompt refinement
- window for IRR: 
  - one-to-one utterance
  - window + 1 on either side
  - window + 2 on either side
